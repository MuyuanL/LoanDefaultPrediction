# LoanDefaultPrediction
CS578 Spring 20 project

## Introduction
In this section we introduce the problem settings in our project. We are interested in the [Loan Default Prediction
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/loan-default-prediction/). The dataset consists of the financial transactions records associated with loans. Each piece
of record comes with a label, which measures the loss in the case of a loan default.
In this project we train a supervised learning model to predict the amount of loss from loan records.
